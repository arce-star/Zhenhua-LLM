### 🤖 Zhenhua-LLM Output
"Years later, in the crowded hospital corridor, Geng Geng walked aimlessly, a sudden sense of inexplicable loneliness surging in her heart. The memories of Zhenhua High School became vivid, and she couldn't help but slow down, retracing the familiar mental routes of her youth.

Yu Huai's figure suddenly appeared at the end of the corridor. He was wearing an ordinary white shirt, his hair a bit messy, and his eyes carried a trace of exhaustion and confusion. At the moment their eyes met, time seemed to freeze.

A complex emotion flashed through Yu Huai's eyes—surprise first, then embarrassment, and finally an unspeakable desolation. Geng Geng's heart rippled, recalling the campus they once walked together, the green smiles, and the carefree days. Every bit of Zhenhua was like an unfinished movie, flashing before her eyes. They used to skip classes together for the library, chase each other on the playground, and make youthful vows under the moonlight.

Yu Huai's eyes held a trace of pain, as if he were reconciling with those lost years. His gaze seemed to say: 'Everything has changed, but those beautiful memories will never fade.'

Finally, Yu Huai broke the silence. He spoke softly, 'Geng Geng, long time no see.'
Geng Geng nodded and smiled back, 'Yu Huai, you've changed too.'"

### 🔍 Stylistic Analysis (风格分析)

1.  **Narrative Pacing**: The model avoids rushing into dialogue, spending the first three paragraphs on "atmosphere building" and "internal state," which is a hallmark of the author's style.
2.  **Thematic Keywords**: It naturally integrates "unfinished movie," "moonlight vows," and "意气风发" (youthful spirit), showing high fidelity to the original text's vocabulary.
3.  **Restraint**: The dialogue is minimal ("Long time no see"), allowing the unsaid emotions to carry the narrative weight.
